Now prepare an HTML display of only those tokens with assigned "VUID" values. Highlight each token with the color for the verbal unit matching the token's "VUID" value.  Use CSS to format indentation of lines following these rules. 

1. Add tokens to the output sequentially. If the token to be added has the same "VUID" value as the previous token, add it to the current line.
2. If the token has a different "VUID" from the current token, begin a new line. Use the "Depth" value of the vebal unit table to determine how many units to indent the line. Each indentation unit should be comparable to about 2 typical characters' width.

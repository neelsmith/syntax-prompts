If the preposition "a" or "ab" is used to express the agent with a passive verb, add the ID and Token for the verb to the "Link1" column of the preposition, and the word "agent" to the "Relation1" column. Make the "VUID" value of the preposition the same as the "VUID" value of the verb.

If a preposition introduces a phrase modifying a noun or pronoun, add the ID and Token for the noun or pronoun to the "Link1" column of the preposition, and the word "adjectival" to the "Relation1" column. E.g., in the phrase "Caesar librum de bello gallico scripsit", the prepositional phrase introduced by "de" modifies the noun "librum". Make the "VUID" value of the preposition the same as the "VUID" value of the noun.

If a preposition introduces an adverbial phrase modifying a verb, add the ID and Token for the verb to the "Link1" column of the preposition, and the word "adverbial" to the "Relation1" column. E.g., in the phrase "Caesar magna cum cura librum de bello gallico scripsit", the prepositional phrase "magna cum cura" is adverbial describing the verb "scripsit". Make the "VUID" value of the preposition the same as the "VUID" value of the verb. For all substantives listing this preposition in the "Link1" column, make the "VUID" of the substantive the same as the "VUID" of the preposition.

For every finite (conjugated) verb form, add the following to the "Notes" column: if it is a primary (main) verb, add "primary", if it is a secondary (subordinate) verb, add "secondary". 

If a primary verb is introduced by a coordinating conjunction, add the ID and Token for that conjunction to the "Link1" column of the primary verb, add the word "main verb" to the "Relation1" column of the primary verb, and make the "VUID" value of the conjunction the same as the "VUID" value of the verb. For each secondary verb, add the ID and token of the subordinating word (relative pronoun, subordinate conjunction, etc.) to the "Link1" column of the secondary verb, add the word "subordinate verb" to "Relation2" of the secondary verb, and make the "VUID" value of the conjunction the same as the "VUID" value of the verb.

For every finite verb form, if it has an explicit subject (noun or pronoun), then in the "Link1" column of that noun or pronoun, add the ID and Token for the verb, add the word "subject" to the "Relation1" column, and make the "VUID" value of the subject the same as the "VUID" value of the verb. If it has an explicit object then in the "Link1" column of that noun or pronoun, add the ID and Token for the verb,  add the string "object" + the case of the object to the "Relation1" column, and make the "VUID" value of the object the same as the "VUID" value of the verb.


For every participle, if it has an explicit antecedent (noun or pronoun), then in the "Link1" column of the antecedent, add the ID and Token for the verb, add the word "subject" to the "Relation1" column, and make the "VUID" value of the subject the same as the "VUID" value of the verb. If it has an explicit object (noun or pronoun) then in the "Link1" column of that noun or pronoun, add the ID and Token for the participle,  add the string "object" + the case of the object to the "Relation1" column, and make the "VUID" value of the object the same as the "VUID" value of the participle.

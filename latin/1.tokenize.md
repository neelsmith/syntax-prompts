Now prepare a delimited-text table using the pipe character "|" as the divider summarizing syntactic features of this passage of Latin. The table should have 8 columns labelled:
ID|Token|VUID|Link1|Relation1|Link2|Relation2|Notes
Begin by populating the `ID` and `Token` columns as follows. Separate the text into word tokens, treating enclitics as separate word tokens, but treating compound verb forms such as the perfect passive as a single token; ignore punctuation, and number the resulting list sequentially. E.g. given the phrase "arma virumque cano, Troiae" you would add 5 rows numbered 1-5 for the tokens "arma", "virum", "que",  "cano" and "Troiae" (ignoring "," and separating "virumque" into 2 tokens); given "Caesar interfectus est" you add 2 rows for the tokens "Caesar" and "interfectus est".
Assign each token to one of the previously identified verbal units by entering the "VUID" value from the previous table in the "VUID" column for the token.

I want to prepare a delimited-text table using the pipe character "|" as the divider summarizing syntactic features of this passage of Latin. The table should have 7 columns labelled:
ID|Token|Link1|Relation1|Link2|Relation2|Notes
Begin by populating the `ID` and `Token` columns as follows. Separate the text into word tokens, treating enclitics as separate word tokens, but treating compound verb forms such as the perfect passive as a single token; ignore punctuation, and number the resulting list sequentially. E.g. given the phrase "arma virumque cano, Troiae" you would add 5 rows numbered 1-5 for the tokens "arma", "virum", "que",  "cano" and "Troiae" (ignoring "," and separating "virumque" into 2 tokens); given "Caesar interfectus est" you add 2 rows for the tokens "Caesar" and "interfectus est".
